[AngularJS + Bootstrap] stand-alone project
=================

A simple project to explore, learn and teach the various features of both AngularJS 
and Bootstrap that does not involve numerous external libraries and/or web framework.  
As such the project can be easily hosted on any web server as is.  Currently, a
web.config file is included since IIS is my web server of choice.

This project is not meant to be production ready as there are functionalities that
were left unfinished as they were not necessary in learning the main technologies.
It is only meant to demonstrate the capabilities of AngularJS and Bootstrap.  
In addition, most of the JavaScript found in the HTML pages are ad-hoc and should 
not be treated as examples of best practices.
